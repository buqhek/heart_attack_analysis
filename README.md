# Predicting Heart Attacks with Hektor

## **Introduction**
First and foremost, I would like acknowledge that this dataset was collected at Zheen Hospital in Erbil, Iraq, from January to May 2019. It includes medical records of patients with the aim of classifying whether an individual had a heart attack. This dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fajobgiua/heart-attack-risk-assessment-dataset), on kaggle.

The main point of this analysis is to build a supervised classification machine learning model that can help hospital staff with diagnosis and risk assessment in patients.
