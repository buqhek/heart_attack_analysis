# Predicting Heart Attacks with Hektor

## **Introduction**
First and foremost, I would like acknowledge that this dataset was collected at Zheen Hospital in Erbil, Iraq, from January to May 2019. It includes medical records of patients with the aim of classifying whether an individual had a heart attack. This dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fajobgiua/heart-attack-risk-assessment-dataset), on kaggle.

The main point of this analysis is to build a supervised classification machine learning model that can help hospital staff with diagnosis and risk assessment in patients.

#### <u>Numerical Columns:</u> 
- **Age** - Patientâ€™s age in years. Older individuals are generally at higher risk for cardiovascular issues.

- **Gender** - A binary indicator:
    - 1 = Male
    - 0 = Female
    
    Gender is a relevant factor in heart disease, with risk profiles varying by sex and age.

- **Heart rate** - Heartbeats per minute. Abnormal heart rate can indicate cardiac stress or underlying issues.

- **Systolic blood pressure** - Pressure in arteries during heartbeats. High systolic values are a significant risk factor for heart attacks.

- **Diastolic blood pressure** - Pressure in arteries between heartbeats. Elevated diastolic pressure also contributes to cardiovascular risk.

- **Blood sugar** - Blood glucose level (in mg/dL).

- **CK-MB** - Creatine kinase-MB enzyme level, a cardiac biomarker. High levels can indicate heart muscle damage.

- **Troponin** - A protein released into the blood when the heart muscle is damaged. Elevated levels are strongly associated with
heart attacks.

#### <u>Categorical Columns:</u>

- **Result** - Classification of the patient's condition:
    - positive = The patient experienced a heart attack
    - negative = No heart attack detected

- **Risk_Level** - A categorical assessment of the patient's heart attack risk based on clinical indicators. Possible values include:
    - Low
    - Moderate
    - High

- **Recommendation** - Medical or lifestyle advice based on the patient's condition and risk level. Common recommendations include:
    - Immediate medical attention (for high-risk or confirmed cases)
    - Monitor closely and consult doctor (for moderate-risk cases)
    - Maintain healthy lifestyle (for low-risk or preventative cases)

## **Exploratory Data Analysis**
Here is a sample of what the patient data looks like:

|    |   Age |   Gender |   Heart rate |   Systolic blood pressure |   Diastolic blood pressure |   Blood sugar |   CK-MB |   Troponin | Result   | Risk_Level   | Recommendation                     |
|---:|------:|---------:|-------------:|--------------------------:|---------------------------:|--------------:|--------:|-----------:|:---------|:-------------|:-----------------------------------|
|  0 |    63 |        1 |           66 |                       160 |                         83 |           160 |    1.8  |      0.012 | negative | Moderate     | Monitor closely and consult doctor |
|  1 |    20 |        1 |           94 |                        98 |                         46 |           296 |    6.75 |      1.06  | positive | High         | Immediate medical attention        |
|  2 |    56 |        1 |           64 |                       160 |                         77 |           270 |    1.99 |      0.003 | negative | Moderate     | Monitor closely and consult doctor |
|  3 |    66 |        1 |           70 |                       120 |                         55 |           270 |   13.87 |      0.122 | positive | High         | Immediate medical attention        |
|  4 |    54 |        1 |           64 |                       112 |                         65 |           300 |    1.08 |      0.003 | negative | Moderate     | Monitor closely and consult doctor |

The first thing that I wanted to do was look at to see if I could determine any patterns within the dataset by creating some visualizations.

The first thing I did when starting my analysis was breaking the dataset into male and female patients. Aggregating the data showed that in this sample population, the percent of male patients who had a heart attack was 65%, whereas female patients who had a heart attack was 55%:

| Gender   |   Proportion of Positive Heart attack |
|:---------|--------------------------------------:|
| Male     |                                64.72% |
| Female   |                                55.01% |

The first thing I decided to look at was the systolic blood pressure in patients and if there was any correlation to age and/or heart attacks. Below is a visualization depicting the data:

<br>

At first we may identify the larger density of points between the 45 and 65 years. We do not see much of a correlation between age ***or*** heart attack results when looking at the systolic blood pressure.

Next was looking at trends in patient's troponin levels. Below is a figure containing troponin levels for males who had a heart attack, and those who did not.

<figcaption align="center"><em>Troponin Levels in Male Patients</em></figcaption>

As seen by the visualization, there is no immediate connection between troponin level and age, but there is a clear connection between troponin level and heart attack. This finding reinforces our understanding of troponin as a protein that is released when the heart muscle is damaged. 

Below is a figure for troponine levels in female patients as well, with equal findings.

I also decided to look at CK-MB levels as well:

<br>

This visualization also showcases the pattern of increased CK-MB levels in patients with heart attacks, and lower levels with those who have not had heart attacks.

Lastly, I decided to check the distribution of heart attack results with respect to each patient's diagnosed "risk level":

| Risk_Level   | Result   |   count |
|:-------------|:---------|--------:|
| High         | positive |     810 |
| High         | negative |       2 |
| Low          | negative |     275 |
| Moderate     | negative |     232 |

I was intrigued to identify that patients that have had heart attacks were diagnosed with a "High" risk level, but even more so that there were only two patients who had a "High" risk level **without** having a heart attack. I decided to look closer at those two patients, with their data shown below:

|     |   Age |   Gender |   Heart rate |   Systolic blood pressure |   Diastolic blood pressure |   Blood sugar |   CK-MB |   Troponin | Result   | Risk_Level   | Recommendation              |
|----:|------:|---------:|-------------:|--------------------------:|---------------------------:|--------------:|--------:|-----------:|:---------|:-------------|:----------------------------|
|  29 |    63 |        1 |           66 |                       135 |                         55 |           166 |   0.493 |     10     | negative | High         | Immediate medical attention |
| 209 |    60 |        1 |           68 |                        42 |                         64 |           106 |   0.879 |      0.426 | negative | High         | Immediate medical attention |

An interesting note is that both patients are male and of similar age. Out of the two patients, patient 209 seemes to have lower troponin and CK-MB levels, which makes it a bit perplexing as to why they were diagnosed with a high risk level. This is particularly interesting as patient 29 displays a relatively high Troponin reading, which would indicate heart damage, and therefore rightfully be diagnosed with a "High" risk level. I decided that this is simply a limitation of the dataset - there could be several key features or nuanced information that made patient 209 also be diagnosed with a "High" risk level despite that information not necessarily being presented in the dataset. This realization will be vital when choosing my target variable when deciding my classification model, below.

## **Framing a Prediction Problem**

### Classification Ideas
The size of the dataset only allows for two possible target variables: `Result` or `Risk_Level`. I initally thought that it would prove quite useful to make `Risk_Level` the target variable for the classification as **every** "High" diagnosis for the risk level was directly correlated to a "positive" Heart attack reading.

However, from my analysis, I saw that all but two patients have a "false positive" reading, meaning that I cannot make this assumption anymore. This slightly decreased my desire to choose `Risk_Level` as the target variable because it would no longer support what would have been a very nice and useful pattern in this dataset (that being, every "High" diagnoses = "positive" heart attack). However, I still believed that the binary classification that would come from predicting the `Result` feature to be not as interesting of a classification problem that I could solve with this data. As a result, I decided to look at the `Risk_Level` feature as my target variable in my predictions, since **every** "High" risk level was always followed by a "Immediate medical attention" recommendation. 

This is important because in the medical field, it is important to minimize type I errors (false negatives), and therefore is okay to have type II errors (false positives).

### Final Decision
Predict `Risk_Level` in patients from the heart attack dataset.
